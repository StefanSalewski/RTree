== RTree

This is the first draft of a generic RTree for Nim.

RTrees are a dynamic index structure for spatial searching.

This implementation follows closely the Guttman paper. Currently only basic procs insert, delete and search are
available. A simple test is included, but I am not currently using this module myself, so it is not really tested yet.

Of course the R*Tree variant of this algorithm is more powerfull (faster). I may provide that later. And I may add
bulk-loading and nearest-neighbour-search, maybe also more search variants.
